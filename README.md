# Azure Search Cross Platform Tutorial

This is a tutorial on how to build a cross platform mobile application using Azure Search and Cordova.  It allows you to build a search enabled mobile application for devices such as iPhone, Android and Windows Phone.

I have split this tutorial into multiple steps to allow you to build out the final application.  The final goal of this tutorial is a mobile application that allows people to search for Historic Sites located in the United States.  Some of the features that will be shown and used in this final application include:

* **Geospatial Search** to allow you to find sites in close proximity to a specific area
* **Filtering & Faceting** to allow you to drill into various categories of historic sites
* **PDF Text Extraction** where the text from PDF's related to these historic sites are indexed and searchacble from the application
* **Spelling Mistake, Stemming & Phonetic Search** to allow users to find content even if they mistype or otherwise make small errors in the search
